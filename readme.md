# Trello clone with jQuery, jQuery UI & Bootstrap

Hello there, and welcome to this assignment where you'll be making a clone
of the popular web application [Trello](https://trello.com) which is used to
create boards, lists and cards for handling basic planning.

0. If you haven't already, head on over to trello.com and register an account.
   Fiddle around with their default board and try and figure out what it is you
   are going to build.

1. Try and run this project. You'll need to: `npm install`, then `npm start`.
2. You should now have your browser open a tab to `localhost:3000` which should show the app template.
3. Try clicking around to see what is logged to the console, then figure out how the code is executed.

## Next steps
- Implement the functionality in each method inside `app.js` - every time you change something the browser will reload automatically.

## Deploying

1. Create a production build by using `npm run build`.
2. Copy the contents of `public` only, and upload that to your Binero-site into the `public_html` folder.
3. Browse to your deployed site.
4. Relax, and be proud.
